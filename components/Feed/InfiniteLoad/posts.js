    post: "Hello World! I’m Dr. Adam John. My qualifications can be seen on my profile but I’m an ENT doctor and have a lot of experience in dealing with Covid patients. I’ve noticed that most patients who’ve had viruses like dengue and malaria respond oddly to the first set of medicines obtained during Covid positivity. They have a slight fever that goes up to 103 Degrees which lasts for a day. Nothing to worry about folks! You’ll be all good and this is just a side effect."

    post: "Hey everyone, I’m Mike from Germany and I just wanted to share my story as a cautionary tale. I had online classes in college and didn’t see my friends for a couple of months but after the lockdown was lifted here I decided to go out and meet my friends regularly. I didn’t treat the virus seriously but now I’m suffering for it. Please take my advice and stay at home. It'll help the country too!"

Here’s a couple of symptoms that he faced when he landed which weren’t conventional : back pain and body pain right before Covid positivity. High temperature and throat pain also were very severe. Please DM me for more of these symptoms"

    post: "Hi all, this is Dr. Nagendra from Sakra. Adding on to my previous post on extra medicines that are required during this virus, patients with no medical background or pre existing symptoms can use Benadryl for excess whooping cough. Another way to cope with this tumultuous time is to have a dose of Fentanyl before sleep. Vegetarian food and healthy meals are always a plus too!"

    post: "Sat Sri Akal, I’m Gurmerhar from Punjab(25) . I tested positive when I had to go back from Canada when the lockdown was announced. It was very stressful, trying to balance out online classes in a different time zone along with stress from not transmitting the virus. One resource that helped me a lot was the Instagram page @theartidote, which shared positive messages and content which helped calm my nerves on social media. Highly Recommended!"

It may seem like the pandemic is getting over and states are removing lockdowns, STAY AT HOME! I have to be isolated in my room and have to worry about my parents catching the virus too. My symptoms are mild, of which I’ll post soon. Stay safe because a lot of people catch the virus during festive seasons too"
